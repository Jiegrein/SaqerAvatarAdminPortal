# Git Cleanup Commands

## üîß Remove Already-Tracked Files from Git

Run these commands in your project root to remove the tracked files:

```bash
# Remove .vs folder from git tracking (but keep local files)
git rm -r --cached .vs/

# Remove bin folders from git tracking  
git rm -r --cached SaqerAvatarAdminPortal/bin/

# Remove obj folders from git tracking
git rm -r --cached SaqerAvatarAdminPortal/obj/

# Stage all changes (including the deletions)
git add -A

# Commit the cleanup
git commit -m "Remove build artifacts and VS files from tracking

- Remove .vs/ folder (Visual Studio cache and settings)
- Remove bin/ and obj/ folders (build outputs)  
- These files are now properly ignored by .gitignore"
```

## ‚ùì What these commands do:

- `git rm -r --cached` removes files from git tracking WITHOUT deleting them from your local machine
- The files will still exist on your computer, but git will stop tracking changes to them
- Future changes to these files will be ignored (thanks to the .gitignore)

## ‚úÖ After running these commands:

- `.vs`, `bin`, `obj` folders will disappear from git status
- They'll still exist on your local machine for development
- New files created in these folders will be automatically ignored
- Your repository will be much cleaner

Run these commands and the files will be properly ignored! üéâ
